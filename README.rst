====================
New Bash Environment
====================

Step-by-step guide to setting up a completely new bash environment to my liking.

Your Bash
---------

Copy the file ``.anysh_profile`` to your home directory and bind it into your
``.bash_profile`` (to be executed on login) or ``.bashrc`` (to be executed on
opening a terminal).

.. code-block:: bash

    cp .ansh_profile ~/

.. code-block:: bash

    if [ -f $HOME/.anysh_profile ];then
        source $HOME/.anysh_profile
    fi

This assumes that ``tmux``, `tmuxifier`_ and ``virtualenv`` and
``virtualenvwrapper`` for Python are installed.

.. _`tmuxifier`: https://github.com/jimeh/tmuxifier

Misc Configuration
------------------

Copy more configuration files, **first edit them to your specific needs**,
creating directories as necessary

.. code-block:: bash

    cp pip.conf ~/.pip/
    cp .tmux.conf ~/
    cp .gitconfig ~/
    cp .gitignore_global ~/

Colours
-------

A very nice colour scheme is Solarized_. If you look on that page or simply
search for *solarized + your program*, you will most likely find something. The
colour schemes I like to set up are:

Terminal
~~~~~~~~

One of:

* gnome-terminal_
* xfce4-terminal_
* KDE_

As a bonus, the KDE_ scheme also works for Kate and Kile.

Then I like to setup directory colours with the following scheme_.

.. _Solarized: http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized
.. _gnome-terminal: https://github.com/Anthony25/gnome-terminal-colors-solarized
.. _xfce4-terminal: https://github.com/sgerrand/xfce4-terminal-colors-solarized
.. _KDE: https://github.com/hayalci/kde-colors-solarized
.. _scheme: https://github.com/seebi/dircolors-solarized

Tmux

SSH
---

If you don't have one, generate an ssh key pair (private - public). You can
follow the `instructions on github`_.

.. _`instructions on github`: https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys

Vim
---

Install one of the following plugin managers:

* pathogen_
* vundle_ (recommended for now?)
* NeoBundle_

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

Additional plugins are already set in the .vimrc but I recommend:

* SrcExpl
* taglist
* Nerdtree
* syntastic
* vim-surround
* solarized

Launch ``vim`` and run ``:PluginInstall``.
